A simple game I made as a birthday gift. 

The objective is to run around as a Third Person Character and collect balloons and candles within the time limit. 
After the time limit has elapsed, a cake will be populated with the number of candles collected while balloons rise in the background, also corresponding to the number of balloons collected during gameplay. 

Most models, animations, and visual effects are from Epic Games' Unreal Learning Kit and Kakky's FXVarietyPack.

Gameplay logic and code functionality is my own.
